    Serverless Computing: Revolutionizing the Cloud Landscape
  </h1>

  <p class="texts__desc">
    Serverless computing, or Function as a Service (FaaS), simplifies cloud development by abstracting server
    management. Serverless architecture allows developers to focus solely on writing code, with cloud providers handling
    server provisioning and scaling automatically.

      <li class="cards__item">
        <h3>
          Monitoring and Debugging
        </h3>
        <p>
          Monitoring and debugging serverless apps can be complex due to their stateless nature
        </p>
